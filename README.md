Hello üëã! I‚Äôm Navyasri Kadiyala, a passionate Data Analyst with a focus on Machine Learning and Data Visualization. With over two years of hands-on experience in the data analytics field, I specialize in transforming complex datasets into clear, actionable insights that drive business growth. I hold a Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science from the University of Kansas, where I gained in-depth knowledge of advanced analytics techniques and technologies.

Throughout my career, I have worked with diverse datasets and applied a variety of tools and methodologies to provide data-driven solutions. I take pride in using data to tell compelling stories, solve problems, and empower decision-makers to take informed actions. My passion lies in making sense of raw data and using it to create impactful business solutions.

üí° My Focus
I specialize in data analysis and visualization, turning raw numbers into meaningful insights. My expertise spans various stages of data analysis, from data cleaning to predictive modeling. I work with tools like Power BI, Tableau, and Python to:

-> Uncover trends and patterns in large datasets.

-> Create interactive dashboards and reports that simplify complex data for stakeholders.

-> Build machine learning models that predict outcomes and optimize business processes.

-> I enjoy making data understandable and actionable, using it to drive strategic decisions across different domains.

üõ†Ô∏è My Approach
I adopt a meticulous and structured approach to every project, focusing on delivering both accuracy and efficiency. From the moment I gather data to the final report or model, my goal is to ensure the process is seamless and the results are reliable.

Data Cleaning & Preparation: I begin with careful data wrangling to ensure that the data is accurate and ready for analysis.
Analysis & Insights: Using advanced analytical techniques, I identify trends, correlations, and insights that can guide business strategy.
Visualization & Reporting: I create clear, actionable visualizations using tools like Power BI and Tableau, so business leaders can make data-driven decisions.
Automation & Efficiency: I use Python and SQL to automate repetitive tasks, saving time and improving the accuracy of reports.
